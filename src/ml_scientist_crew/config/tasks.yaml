dataset_analysis:
  description: >
    Analyze the dataset located at {path}.

    Explain in simple terms:
    - What the dataset is about
    - What each type of feature represents
    - Which column is the target
    - Whether this is a classification or regression problem
    - Any missing values or data quality issues

    Do NOT use generic explanations.
    Be specific to the given dataset.
  expected_output: >
    A clear dataset summary including:
    - Dataset purpose
    - Target column
    - Feature types
    - Missing values
    - Potential risks or limitations


research_planning:
  description: >
    Based on the dataset analysis, design a machine learning plan.

    Clearly explain:
    - What we are trying to predict
    - Which models should be tried and why
    - How the models will be compared
    - Which evaluation metrics make sense for this problem
  expected_output: >
    A structured experiment plan written in plain English.


model_training:
  description: >
    Train baseline machine learning models using the dataset at {path}.

    Focus on:
    - Training multiple standard models
    - Observing relative performance
    - Not overfitting or heavy tuning

    If exact metrics are unavailable, describe performance qualitatively.
  expected_output: >
    A comparison-style summary describing how each model performed.


model_evaluation:
  description: >
    Compare all trained models and decide which one is the best.

    Explain:
    - Which model performed best overall
    - Why it performed better than others
    - Trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability
  expected_output: >
    A clear and honest model selection explanation.

    Write the FINAL PROJECT REPORT using the structure below:

    1. Problem Overview
    2. Dataset Summary
    3. Models Trained
    4. Model Performance Comparison
    5. Best Model and Reasoning
    6. Important Features (explained simply)
    7. Limitations of the Current Approach
    8. Future Improvements
    9. Final Conclusion

    The report MUST:
    - Be easy to understand
    - Be specific to the dataset
    - Be written in markdown
    - Be suitable for GitHub and resume review
  expected_output: >
    A complete, human-readable markdown report.
